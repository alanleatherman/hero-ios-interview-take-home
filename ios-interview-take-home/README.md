- They can send and receive a message back in the chat.

# Goal
- Implement the UI using the provided structs and classes in `Models` and `Repositories` folders.
- Implement the UI how you think is best.
- Feel free to change any code in this project.
- Feel free to use SwiftUI or UIKit (Configure this in `SceneDelegate.willConnectTo`).
- You do not need to spend more than 4 hours on this.
